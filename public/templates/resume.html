  <p class="myabouts">I first developed a passion for programming during a coding workshop. The realization that I could contribute the knowledge and experience I gained from twelve years in the Entertainment industry to the tech world and create new services and products that would positively impact people’s lives motivated me to dive into web development full-time. Having spent 600+ hours in 3 months learning and building web applications at General Assembly’s immersive bootcamp and since November 2015 working for a new ambitious start-up I am confident that my combination of creative and technical skills will contribute positively to your team.</p>
